## ðŸ”­ Projects

Here are some interesting projects I've worked on:

### 1. [Packet Watchers](https://github.com/jcamel2/Packet_Watchers) w/ [Design Doc](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/27eomd9hs1iz6dc74i0y4/Project-2-Design-Doc.paper?rlkey=8bt3ph55rdb0h7k186tn87u3f&dl=0)

- **Description**: A file sharing system that has to account for DataStore and KeyStore Adversaries trying to steal and alter the file system. Encryption and Decryption strategies are used throughout the project to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticated access for all users.

- **Technologies Used**: Go, VS Code, DropBox

- **Key Features**:
  - User authenitication with passwords, keys, and not allowing any duplicates of any sort.

### 2. [Spam n Ham](https://github.com/jcamel2/Spam_n_Ham)

- **Description**: A class project that was made to help distinguish spam emails from normal ones. Data Science classification strategies such as training-validation split, feature engineering and EDA were used to separate the two types of emails. Data analysis was key in deciding which features to focus on.
  
- **Technologies Used**: Pandas, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook

- **Key Features**:
  - Logistic regression in order to fit the training sets accordingly.
  - Evaluating true/false positives and true/false negatives to determine how accurate our predictive model was.
  - Creating my own model and using ROC curves to express how accurate my classifications were.
